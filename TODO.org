** Submodules vs. Independence
vm.grtcdr.tn as of this moment employs a very independent
architecture, sub-projects (vm.grtcdr.tn/dork and vm.grtcdr.tn/dbms3)
implement their own project specification (publish.el) and build
system (Makefile), this is helpful if these project expand beyond
their trivial structure, but is currently overkill.
